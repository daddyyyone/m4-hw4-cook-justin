                    Donna Summer's music career soared in the 1970s when her disco dance songs became synonymous with the era. She was the first artist to have three consecutive double albums reach number one on the US Billboard chart. Even after disco faded from popularity, she continued producing music well into the 1980s and remained influential until her passing in 2012.
